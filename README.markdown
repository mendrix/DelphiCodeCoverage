# Delphi Code Coverage

## Introduction
Delphi Code Coverage is a simple Code Coverage tool for Delphi that creates code coverage reports 
based on detailed MAP files.

Please also check out [this project](http://code.google.com/p/delphi-code-coverage-wizard/) as it adds a wizard to the 
Delphi IDE to help create configuration and launch Delphi Code Coverage.

## Preconditions
The project you want to run a code coverage report for must have a "debug" configuration that generates a 
detailed MAP file.

## What kind of code coverage does it do
Delphi Code Coverage currently only measures "line coverage", i.e. it will track each line that code was generated for 
and mark it if it was executed.

## Coverage of DLLs and BPLs
For applications who uses Borland Package Libraries (which are essentially DLLs) or external DLLs, DCC will attempt to 
load a .map file for each DLL and if it exists and units in those libraries are part of the covered units, 
code coverage will span the DLL/BPL loaded as part of the application. The .map file need to exist in the same 
directory as the dll that was loaded.

## Usage
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/mendrix/DelphiCodeCoverage/releases), 
unzip the file and put it for example in your Delphi installations "bin" directory or somewhere where it is in 
the "path". 

All parameters understand also environment variables in batch style (e.g. %WINDIR% etc.)
If a file is used for the source directories (see `-spf`) there are also Environment variables allowed.
It is possibile to exclude specific units in the units file (see `-uf`) by prepending a "!" before the unit name.

Open a command line prompt in the directory where your compiled application and executable is. 

Type: `CodeCoverage -m TestApp.map -e TestApp.exe -u TestUnit TestUnit2 -xml -html`

## Output
### HTML output (specify `-html` as a parameter)
For each unit there will be a unit.html with a summary of the coverage, followed by the source marked up. 
Green lines were covered. Red lines were not covered lines. The other lines didn't have code generated for it. 
There is also a CodeCoverage_summary.html file that summarizes the coverage and has links to the generated unit reports.

### XML output (specify `-xml` as a parameter)
A summary xml report called CodeCoverage_summary.xml is generated in the output directory that is compatible with the 
xml output from EMMA. Use in combination with the switches '-xmllines' and '-xmlgenerics' for detailed code coverage per line.

### Emma output (specify `-emma` or `-emma21` as a parameter)
It is now possible to create EMMA compatible output which allows for using emma to merge multiple code coverage runs as 
well as using emma for generating reports.

### Delphi compatibility
DCC is compatible with Delphi up tot 10.4.2, both 32 and 64 bit.

### SonarQube integration
You can integrate the results of the xml report in SonarQube. See the [Delphi SonarQube plugin](https://github.com/mendrix/SonarDelphi)
for detailed information.

### Hudson integration
You can integrate the xml report using the Hudson EMMA plugin. The html report can be integrated using the 
HTML Publisher plugin.

### Sponsors
The latest released were made possible through the generous support of DevFactory and MendriX.

### Inspiration
This project was inspired by great tools in the Java world such as Emma. This project has been lingering in an 
unfinished form on my harddrive for more than a year. Finally it slipped out.
